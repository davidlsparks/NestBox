# NestBox

## Introduction

This nest box is designed for chickadees, wrens, and other small birds. The entrance is 1-1/4" (~32mm) which should keep starlings and other larger birds out. For extra protection, you can glue or nail a piece of hardwood over the entrance, as you'll see in the image I provided of the fully assembled box.

## Camera

I purchased a relatively inexpensive camera on Aliexpress. There are a number of vendors who sell the same or similar product under other names. I chose the 5MP with a 2.8mm lens.

If you purchase a different camera, you'll probably need to modify the camera mount and clamp. If running an Ethernet cable is an issue, this camera also supports WiFi. There's enough room above the camera mount to put a decent size battery inside, or you can run a DC power adapter into it.

## Material

I used 1x6 cedar for all the wood parts except for the hole reinforcement plate, which is white oak. The parts diagram assumes a true 3/4" thickness and 5-1/2" width. My cedar was undersized at 11/16" and I ran it through a planar to clean it up, taking it down to 5/8".

If your material is a different thickness, you'll need to adjust the width of the front back and roof appropriately. For example, for 5/8" material, my front and back were cut to 5-1/4" instead of 5-1/2". I left the roof at 5-1/2" so it's slightly proud on both sides.

## Assembly

Assembly is pretty straightforward. I drilled out the holes for the dowel pin hinges. I chose to glue the dowel pins into the side rather than the front and back. I also attached cleats to the front and back to support the floor and simplify the assembly.

I recommend using a water-resistant glue like Titebond III if you are planning to glue it together. I used glue and then tacked everything down with a pin nailer. Screws will also work - I suggest stainless or coated to prevent corrosion.

I recommend not attaching the camera mount plate to the box. I undersized the mount plate slightly so I can pull it out and replace the camera.

I also cut a 1/4" vent on the front just below the roof to allow for some circulation. I used a 1/2" straight bit on the router table, but a jigsaw, coping saw, or chisel would also work.

## 3D Printed Parts

I have included .STP and .STL files for the 3D printed parts. These are optional. You can buy hardware or fabricate them from wood instead.
